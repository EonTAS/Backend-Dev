# Credits: 

LO1 Design, develop and implement a back-end for a full-stack web application using Python and a micro-framework

- 1.1	Design a front end for a data-driven web application that meets accessibility guidelines, follows the principles of UX design, meets its given purpose and provides a set of user interactions -
- 1.2	Implement custom HTML and CSS code to create a responsive full-stack application consisting of one or more HTML pages with relevant responses to user actions and a set of data manipulation functions -
- 1.3	Build a non-relational database-backed Flask web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain. -
- 1.4	Design a database structure that is relevant for your domain, consisting of a minimum of one collection. -
- 1.5	Design and implement manual test procedures to assess functionality, usability, responsiveness and data management within the Full Stack web application -
- 1.6	Write Python code that is consistent in style and conforms to the PEP8 style guide (or another explicitly mentioned style guide, such as Google's) and validated HTML and CSS code. =.
- 1.7	Include sufficient custom Python logic to to demonstrate your proficiency in the language -
- 1.8	Include functions with compound statements such as if conditions and/or loops in your Python code -
- 1.9	Write code that meets minimum standards for readability (comments, indentation, consistent and meaningful naming conventions). ..
- 1.10	Name files consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalisation to allow for cross-platform compatibility. -

LO2 Demonstrate competence in modeling and managing non-relational data effectively

- 2.1	Design a data model that fits the purpose of the project -
- 2.2	Develop the model into a usable non-relational database where data is stored in a consistent and well-organised manner. -


LO3 Demonstrate competence in querying and manipulating non-relational data effectively

- 3.1	Create functionality for users to create, locate, display, edit and delete records -


LO4 Deploy a full stack web application to a cloud platform

- 4.1	Deploy a final version of the full-stack application code to a cloud-based hosting platform (e.g. Heroku) and test to ensure it matches the development version 
- 4.2	Ensure that final deployed code is free of commented out code and has no broken internal links 
- 4.3	Document the deployment process in a README file in English that also explains the applicationâ€™s purpose and the value that it provides to its users 

LO5 Identify and apply security features

- 5.1	Use Git & GitHub for version control of a Full Stack web application up to deployment, using commit messages to document the development process. -
- 5.2	Commit final code that is free of any passwords or security sensitive information, to the repository and to the hosting platform -
- 5.3	Use environment variables, or files that are in .gitignore, to hide all secret keys -
- 5.4	Ensure that DEBUG mode is turned off in production versions -
