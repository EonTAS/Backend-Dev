Store, Log In, Create Account

to 

Store, Basket, Account, Log Out

based on log in

Account has a button for previous purchases, as well as just listing user details

LO1 Design, develop and implement a back-end for a full-stack web application using Python and a micro-framework

- 1.1	Design a front end for a data-driven web application that meets accessibility guidelines, follows the principles of UX design, meets its given purpose and provides a set of user interactions
- 1.2	Implement custom HTML and CSS code to create a responsive full-stack application consisting of one or more HTML pages with relevant responses to user actions and a set of data manipulation functions
- 1.3	Build a non-relational database-backed Flask web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.
- 1.4	Design a database structure that is relevant for your domain, consisting of a minimum of one collection.
- 1.5	Design and implement manual test procedures to assess functionality, usability, responsiveness and data management within the Full Stack web application
- 1.6	Write Python code that is consistent in style and conforms to the PEP8 style guide (or another explicitly mentioned style guide, such as Google's) and validated HTML and CSS code.
- 1.7	Include sufficient custom Python logic to to demonstrate your proficiency in the language
- 1.8	Include functions with compound statements such as if conditions and/or loops in your Python code
- 1.9	Write code that meets minimum standards for readability (comments, indentation, consistent and meaningful naming conventions).
- 1.10	Name files consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalisation to allow for cross-platform compatibility.

LO2 Demonstrate competence in modeling and managing non-relational data effectively

- 2.1	Design a data model that fits the purpose of the project
- 2.2	Develop the model into a usable non-relational database where data is stored in a consistent and well-organised manner.


LO3 Demonstrate competence in querying and manipulating non-relational data effectively

- 3.1	Create functionality for users to create, locate, display, edit and delete records


LO4 Deploy a full stack web application to a cloud platform

- 4.1	Deploy a final version of the full-stack application code to a cloud-based hosting platform (e.g. Heroku) and test to ensure it matches the development version
- 4.2	Ensure that final deployed code is free of commented out code and has no broken internal links
- 4.3	Document the deployment process in a README file in English that also explains the applicationâ€™s purpose and the value that it provides to its users

LO5 Identify and apply security features

- 5.1	Use Git & GitHub for version control of a Full Stack web application up to deployment, using commit messages to document the development process.
- 5.2	Commit final code that is free of any passwords or security sensitive information, to the repository and to the hosting platform
- 5.3	Use environment variables, or files that are in .gitignore, to hide all secret keys
- 5.4	Ensure that DEBUG mode is turned off in production versions
