# Purpose of the Project :

Create a stock management website that makes use of a database to track how much of each item is in stock and track purchases made by individual users.

stored on mongoDB - https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/61139e25f0eba81f9f45682c#metrics/replicaSet/613f6895e52339380b7ad052/explorer/Stock/stock/find

# Database Plan

stock:
-   name
-   type
-   cost
-   description
-   image_url
-   boughtBy
-   sold
users:

- Add 2 new Collections in the database, one names "users" and one named "stock" (or modify code as appropriate)

- Press the Databases button on the left of the site

- click the "Connect button" on your cluster and select "connect your application"

- select Database access and create a new root user with a password you decide on

- select python as your driver and copy the uri provided on this page for later use, modifying it to have the root password you specified above.

## Heroku steps

- Press the New Button at the top right of the Heroku dashboard

- Press "Create new app"

- Give the app a unique app name and a good region and create app

- On the page that opens, select Github in the "Deployment method" section

- Select your repo

- Go to Settings tab at the top of the page

- Go to the Config Vars section and press "Reveal Config Vars"

- Add a var for IP, MONGO_DBNAME, MONGO_URI, PORT and SECRET_KEY (URI selected from above, DBNAME as you named it, etc)
